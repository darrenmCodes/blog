2:01am GMT 02/12/2025, my bedroom desk.

In what can only be described as a typical day, I have only just got the opportunity to stop working and realise it’s already December, what?

I think this year has probably been one that will go down in the books for various reasons, some good, some bad, but I will say one thing and that is: 12 months ago had you asked me where I’d be in a year, I don’t think I would have guessed anywhere near here.  

Anyways, I suppose this is the introductory posting to my blog? I don’t necessarily like using the word blog, I feel there are certain expectations with that. I want to use this more so as a way to put my (within reason) unfiltered thoughts out there, for anyone who may be here because they know me, or even those who just stumbled across this conveniently named domain 
(there aren’t a tonne of Darren Mahers out there)

I’m going to use this post to discuss and figure out some of my potential plans for the next year.

Really at the minute, I’m enjoying what I’m doing, I really don’t want to change a whole lot.

The only foreseeable change I can see in what I’m doing is scale.

I want to scale up everything I do, in the hopes that the rewards will scale in a somewhat derivative manner.

i.e. working on recreo, I feel like I’ve been in the shallow end so far, and I’m unsatisfied with this.

For certain reasons which probably shouldn’t be discussed here, there’s been some depressingly stagnant progress being made.

With the certain reasons having nicely sorted themselves out, I think it’s now time to open the flood gates and just go absolutely ape shit, I want to see how much meaningful progress I am capable of making in a short amount of time.

I have 3 particular goals in mind, which again probably won’t be shared on here, but if I execute the way I want, and I am next to certain I can, then next year will be even more significant for me than this one has.


In other news, I’m heading to Warsaw in about 28 hours. It should be good fun.

I’m going to go finish up some work then go to bed, long day tomorrow
